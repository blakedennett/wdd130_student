    <h2>Blake Dennett</h2>
    <p>I am from Las Vegas, Nevada. I've lived in Rexburg for 3 years. I served my mission 
       I've been married for about a year and a half. My wife came with a dog named Luna. 
       I enjoy reading books, having quality conversations, and excercise. One thing about
       me is that I am very organized. I have all of my shirts scheduled for the week! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a computer science major and I plan to go into machine learning, probably with financials. 
        I currently am considering getting a masters or PHD in the field. I am also getting a minor in 
        software management.
    </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 17 years. I unfortunately 
        don't have a favorite scripture but I love the second chapter of second Nephi.
